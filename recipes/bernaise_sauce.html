    <h3>Description</h3>    
    <p>Infused with tarragon and shallots, this modified hollandaise sauce pairs perfectly 
        with any <br>and all cuts of steak or roasts, especially lean ones. My all time favourite
        steak sauce!

        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh tarragon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon drained and dried capers</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cold unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bernaise</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large egg yollks</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons tarragon-vinegar reduction</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon caper-tarragon compound butter</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 1 cup tarragon, shallots, and peppercorns in a saucepan. 
            Pour in white wine vinegar, white wine, and water. <br>Place over medium-high heat 
            and bring to a simmer; stir. Reduce heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle 
            simmer and reduce <br>liquid to about 3 tablespoons, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from 
            heat. Strain into a bowl through a fine mesh strainer, <br>pressing vegetable/herb 
            mixture to extract as much liquid as possible.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place 1/4 cup chopped tarragon and capers in a mortar. Mash with a pestle about 
            1 minute. Add 1 tablespoon cold butter. Mash <br>and pound with pestle until ingredients 
            are thoroughly combined in a solid mass. Transfer to a piece of plastic wrap; wrap 
            and chill.</li> 
        <br>      
        <li>Place egg yolks in a stainless steel (flameproof) mixing bowl; add 3 tablespoons 
            tarragon/shallot reduction; whisk together. Add cold <br>butter cubes. Place bowl over low 
            to medium heat whisking constantly until sauce thickens, as you hold the bowl with a 
            kitchen towel. <br>After butter melts continue whisking; mixture will turn a lighter yellow 
            color after 8 to 10 minutes. When mixture is nice and thick, <br>reduce heat to low and stir 
            in compound butter broken into chunks. Continue whisking. Remove from heat. <br>Season with 
            salt, and black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
